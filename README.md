# Swyne-AI
## Further evolution of [Swyne-prj](https://github.com/MoonlightTaVi/Swyne-prj) (probably abandoned), which was meant to be an example of universal Domain Specific Language, using Natural Language Processing algorhytm.
The work has started on October, 12th, 2024.
This is a simple, pretty light-weight and optimized (I believe) neural network, which can be used for different purposes.
It is meant to replace Swyne-prj in the field of proccessing user's input, parsing it to the programm's hardcoded methods (depending on the goal) and displaying some output.
Currently it's a work-in-progress.
Made without using any AI or NLP libraries.
## To do list:
* Batching words into prefixes, suffixes, endings, etc. to automatically sort them into related groups.
* Optimize RAM usage by making a HashMap of the most frequently used tokens.
* Store all unneccessary data in the SQLite.
* More data to train the network on.
* Swing interface.
* Some minor stuff.
